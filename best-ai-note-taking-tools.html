  <h1>Best AI Note-Taking Tools</h1>

  <p>
    AI note-taking is most valuable when it turns notes into action: summaries, decisions, tasks, and follow-ups.
    This guide focuses on tools that help you capture information and convert it into usable output.
  </p>

  <h2>Best Overall: Notion AI</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Best for:</strong> building a personal knowledge base + tasks + docs</li>
    <li><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> notes live next to work, so ideas become execution</li>
    <li><strong>Edge move:</strong> create a “Decision Log” table and store final decisions with rationale</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Best for Meeting Notes: Otter / Fireflies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Best for:</strong> meeting transcripts + searchable summaries</li>
    <li><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> reduces repeated meetings by preserving decisions and action items</li>
    <li><strong>Edge move:</strong> always extract “Decisions + Owners + Deadlines” automatically</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Best for Simple Note Capture: Google Docs + AI Assistant</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Best for:</strong> lightweight note capture and summarization</li>
    <li><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> low friction; works everywhere</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Copy/Paste Prompt: Turn Notes Into Action</h2>
  <p>Use this prompt with your notes or meeting transcript:</p>
  <pre>
Convert these notes into:
1) Key points
2) Decisions made
3) Action items (with suggested owners)
4) Risks / open questions
5) Next steps for the next 7 days
Format clearly and concisely.
  </pre>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <h3>What should I optimize for?</h3>
  <p>Searchability, decision capture, and task extraction. Notes are useless if they don’t turn into action.</p>

  <h3>What’s the biggest “unfair advantage” move?</h3>
  <p>Maintaining a searchable decision log so you stop re-litigating the same topics repeatedly.</p>
